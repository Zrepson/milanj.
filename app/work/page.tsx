            <h2>A multidisciplinary professional.</h2>
            <p>
              My work brings together life insurance advisory, project and
              program coordination, operations, administration, digital
              development and sustainable development initiatives.
            </p>
            <p>
              I currently serve as a Life Insurance Consultant with Life
              Insurance Corporation (Nepal) Limited (LIC Nepal). I work with
              individuals and families to understand life insurance, financial
              protection and long-term security through informed,
              client-focused advice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Earlier in my career, I contributed to public health, biomedical
              engineering, emergency response, humanitarian and development
              initiatives. This work brought me together with government,
              development, technical and private-sector partners, and
              strengthened my capabilities in planning, implementation,
              stakeholder coordination, documentation, operations and
              problem-solving.
            </p>
            <p>
              My professional perspective sits at the intersection of people,
              systems, technology and execution. I bring structured thinking,
              operational discipline and clear communication to complex work,
              connecting strategic objectives with practical implementation
              and measurable outcomes while adapting to changing environments.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am also interested in emerging technologies and modern
              life-saving tools, including artificial intelligence, drones,
              digital communication and user-centered digital experiences.
              My journey reflects an ongoing effort to bridge strategic
              thinking with execution, professional discipline with emerging
              technology, and individual expertise with broader social impact.

            I don&apos;t see life as a straight line. It is a network of roads—some

            open to where they lead. My aim is to contribute with curiosity
