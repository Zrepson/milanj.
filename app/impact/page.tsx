              <p>
                I have a strong personal interest in the <strong>United Nations
                Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</strong> and the broader
                global development agenda. I see the SDGs as an important
                framework for understanding some of the world&apos;s most pressing
                challenges and for encouraging meaningful action at the
                individual, community, national, and global levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                My interests include <strong>sustainable cities and communities,
                climate action, good health and well-being, quality education,
                decent work, innovation, social inclusion, humanitarian response,
                and responsible development.</strong> Through my professional
                experience, community engagement, volunteering, continuous
                learning, and personal initiatives, I seek opportunities to
                contribute to areas that support a more inclusive, resilient, and
                sustainable future.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am particularly interested in how <strong>individual action,
                technology, community participation, responsible institutions,
                and cross-sector collaboration</strong> can contribute to
                sustainable development. I believe meaningful change does not
                always begin with large organizations—it can also begin with
                informed individuals taking practical action within their
                communities.
              </p>
              <p className="work-interest-disclaimer">
                My engagement with the SDGs represents a <strong>personal
                commitment and area of interest</strong>, rather than an official
                affiliation or representation of the United Nations. I continue
                to learn, participate, and explore ways to translate global
                development principles into practical initiatives and everyday
                action.
