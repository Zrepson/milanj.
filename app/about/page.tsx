              Travelling through different parts of Nepal has introduced me to
              new landscapes, communities and ways of seeing the world. Home,
              to me, is made of people, memories, places and shared
              responsibilities.

              Mountains have a special place in my imagination. They remind me
              that a change in perspective can reveal a new route. Time away
              from a screen, somewhere unfamiliar, often gives me the space to
              think and return with better questions.
